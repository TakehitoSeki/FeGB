## Grain boundary structures
These files are the structural data of the steel grain boundaries obtained theoretically in the following paper:
T. Seki et al., "Incommensurate grain-boundary atomic structure", Nature Communications (2023).

The data are written in the VASP format.
The a-axis corresponds to [110] axis of the bcc structure.
Fig. 3b and Supplementary Fig. 5 were created based on these structural data.
